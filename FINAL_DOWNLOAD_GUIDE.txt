ðŸŽ¯ DOWNLOAD YOUR ENSEMBLE MODEL FILES
====================================

The automatic download didn't get the model files. Here are your options:

ðŸ“‹ OPTION 1: MANUAL DOWNLOAD (Easiest)
=====================================

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sahandsameer/ab-ensemble
3. Make sure your notebook shows "Committed" (not just saved)
4. Scroll to the very bottom of the notebook
5. Look for an "Output" section with files
6. Download each file manually:

   ðŸ”¹ best_model_all_out_v1.pth (Champion model ~100-300MB)
   ðŸ”¹ optimal_thresholds_all_out_v1.json (Thresholds ~1KB)
   ðŸ”¹ model.pth.tar (Arnoweng model ~100-300MB)  
   ðŸ”¹ optimal_thresholds_ensemble_final_v1.json (Ensemble thresholds ~1KB)
   ðŸ”¹ final_metrics_ensemble_final_v1.json (Metrics ~2KB)
   ðŸ”¹ classification_report_ensemble_final_v1.txt (Report ~3KB)

7. Save ALL files to: C:\Users\Dara Mustafa\Desktop\x-ray\kaggle_outputs\

ðŸ”§ OPTION 2: KAGGLE API SETUP (For Future Use)
=============================================

If you want to use the API command later:

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/account
2. Scroll to "API" section
3. Click "Create New API Token"
4. Download kaggle.json
5. Place it at: C:\Users\Dara Mustafa\.kaggle\kaggle.json
6. Then run: kaggle kernels output sahandsameer/ab-ensemble -p ./kaggle_outputs

âœ… AFTER DOWNLOADING (Either Method):
===================================

Run this to verify all files are present:
python quick_check.py

If all files are found, test your ensemble model:
python scripts/ensemble_inference.py --image your_chest_xray.png --kaggle-outputs ./kaggle_outputs --visualize

ðŸš¨ TROUBLESHOOTING:
==================

If the files aren't in the notebook output:
- Make sure you ran all cells in your notebook
- Check that the final cells actually saved the files
- Look for a "Data" tab in your notebook that might contain the files
- The large .pth files are the most important (model checkpoints)

ðŸ’¡ The manual download is often more reliable than the API for large files!

ðŸŽ¯ GOAL: Get those 6 files into the kaggle_outputs folder so you can run your amazing ensemble model!

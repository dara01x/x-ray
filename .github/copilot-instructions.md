- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	<!-- Project type: Professional radiology AI for chest X-ray disease classification using PyTorch -->

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	<!--
	✅ COMPLETED: Created complete project structure with:
	- Source code modules (models, data, training, evaluation, utils)
	- Executable scripts (train.py, evaluate.py, inference.py)
	- Configuration files (config.yaml)
	- Testing framework (pytest with comprehensive tests)
	- Documentation (README.md, LICENSE)
	- Setup tools (requirements.txt, setup.py, .gitignore)
	-->

- [x] Customize the Project
	<!--

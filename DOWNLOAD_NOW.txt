🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Download Your Model Files
=========================================================

Your ensemble model integration is 95% complete! 
You just need to download 6 files from your Kaggle notebook.

🔗 STEP-BY-STEP DOWNLOAD PROCESS:
================================

1. 🌐 Open your web browser
2. 📱 Go to Kaggle.com and log in
3. 📝 Navigate to your "ab-ensemble" notebook
4. 📊 Make sure your notebook shows "Committed" (not just saved)
5. 📁 Scroll to the bottom - look for "Output" section
6. 📥 Download these 6 files:

   📄 best_model_all_out_v1.pth (Large file ~100-300MB)
   📄 optimal_thresholds_all_out_v1.json (Small file ~1KB)  
   📄 model.pth.tar (Large file ~100-300MB)
   📄 optimal_thresholds_ensemble_final_v1.json (Small file ~1KB)
   📄 final_metrics_ensemble_final_v1.json (Small file ~2KB)
   📄 classification_report_ensemble_final_v1.txt (Small file ~3KB)

7. 💾 Save ALL files to this folder:
   C:\Users\Dara Mustafa\Desktop\x-ray\kaggle_outputs\

8. ✅ After downloading, run: python download_kaggle_files.py

🚨 IMPORTANT NOTES:
==================
- The large .pth files (model checkpoints) are the most important
- Make sure files download completely (check file sizes)
- Don't rename the files - keep exact names
- If download fails, try one file at a time

💡 KAGGLE NOTEBOOK OUTPUT LOCATION:
==================================
In your ab-ensemble notebook, the output files are typically at:
- Bottom of the notebook in "Output" section
- Or in the "Data" tab if you created a dataset
- Or click the "..." menu → "Download" for the notebook

🎉 AFTER DOWNLOADING:
====================
Once you have all 6 files, your ensemble model will be ready to use!

You'll be able to run:
python scripts/ensemble_inference.py --image chest_xray.png --kaggle-outputs ./kaggle_outputs --visualize

This will give you:
- Individual model predictions
- Ensemble prediction  
- Visualization comparing both models
- Detailed disease probability scores
- Professional medical AI analysis

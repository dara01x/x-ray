🔄 NOTEBOOK RE-RUN GUIDE
========================

Your Kaggle notebook shows no output files. Here's how to fix it:

📝 STEP 1: Check Your Notebook
------------------------------
1. Go to your ab-ensemble notebook on Kaggle
2. Look at the last few cells - did they all run successfully?
3. Check for any error messages in red
4. Look for cells that save files (like Cell K and Cell L)

🔄 STEP 2: Re-run Key Cells
---------------------------
If some cells failed, re-run these important ones:
- Cell K: "Save Final Ensemble Results" 
- Cell L: "Save All Final Ensemble Results"
- Any cells that mention saving .pth or .json files

Or simply re-run the entire notebook:
1. Click "Run All" at the top
2. Wait for all cells to complete (may take 30-60 minutes)
3. Make sure no cells show errors

💾 STEP 3: Check Output After Re-run
-----------------------------------
After re-running, you should see these files in the Output tab:
- best_model_all_out_v1.pth
- optimal_thresholds_all_out_v1.json
- model.pth.tar  
- optimal_thresholds_ensemble_final_v1.json
- final_metrics_ensemble_final_v1.json
- classification_report_ensemble_final_v1.txt

🎯 ALTERNATIVE: Create Test Files
=================================
If re-running is problematic, we can create placeholder files to test the integration:

1. Create empty files with correct names
2. Test the ensemble loading system
3. Replace with real files later

Would you like me to create test files so you can see the ensemble system working?

⚠️ NOTE: The large .pth files (models) are essential for actual inference,
but we can test the system architecture without them initially.

üîê KAGGLE API SETUP REQUIRED
============================

The download failed because Kaggle API credentials are not set up.

üéØ QUICK SETUP (5 minutes):
===========================

STEP 1: Get Your API Token
---------------------------
1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/account
2. Scroll down to the "API" section  
3. Click "Create New API Token"
4. This downloads a file called "kaggle.json"

STEP 2: Place the File
----------------------
Move the downloaded kaggle.json file to:
C:\Users\Dara Mustafa\.kaggle\kaggle.json

If the .kaggle folder doesn't exist, create it:
mkdir C:\Users\Dara Mustafa\.kaggle

STEP 3: Download Your Files
---------------------------
After setting up the API credentials, run:

kaggle kernels output sahandsameer/ab-ensemble -p ./kaggle_outputs

Or use this Python command:
python -c "import kaggle; kaggle.api.kernels_output('sahandsameer/ab-ensemble', path='./kaggle_outputs')"

üöÄ ALTERNATIVE: Manual Download
===============================

If the API setup seems complicated, you can still download manually:

1. Go to https://www.kaggle.com/code/sahandsameer/ab-ensemble
2. Make sure the notebook is "Committed" (not just saved)
3. Scroll to the bottom output section
4. Download each file individually:
   - best_model_all_out_v1.pth
   - optimal_thresholds_all_out_v1.json
   - model.pth.tar
   - optimal_thresholds_ensemble_final_v1.json
   - final_metrics_ensemble_final_v1.json
   - classification_report_ensemble_final_v1.txt

5. Save all files to: C:\Users\Dara Mustafa\Desktop\x-ray\kaggle_outputs\

‚úÖ VERIFICATION:
===============
After downloading (either method), run:
python quick_check.py

This will verify all files are present and ready to use!

üí° TIP: The API method is faster for large files, but manual download 
       is more reliable if you're having issues.

6. **Research** - Share findings, benchmarks, and improvements

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radiology-ai.git
   cd radiology-ai
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow **PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for function parameters and returns
- Write **descriptive docstrings** for all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Add **comments** for complex medical/AI logic

### Code Formatting

We use automated tools for consistent formatting:

```bash
# Install development tools
pip install black isort flake8

# Format code
black src/ tests/ scripts/
isort src/ tests/ scripts/

# Check for style issues
flake8 src/ tests/ scripts/
```

### Testing Requirements

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

- **Unit tests** for new functions/classes
- **Integration tests** for new features
- **Regression tests** for bug fixes
- Maintain **>95% test coverage**

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# View coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Medical AI Best Practices

When contributing to medical AI components:

1. **Patient Privacy**: Never include real patient data
2. **Validation**: Include appropriate medical validation
3. **Explainability**: Ensure AI decisions can be interpreted
4. **Bias**: Consider and test for potential bias
5. **Disclaimers**: Include medical disclaimers in documentation

## üî¨ Research Contributions

### Benchmarking

When submitting performance improvements:

- Include **comparison metrics** (AUC, sensitivity, specificity)

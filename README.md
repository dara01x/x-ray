# ü©∫ X-Ray AI Web Application

**AI-powered chest X-ray analysis with 14 disease detection**

A user-friendly web application that uses advanced deep learning models to analyze chest X-ray images and detect 14 different thoracic diseases including Pneumonia, Cardiomegaly, and more.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dara01x/x-ray.git
cd x-ray

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the web app
python app_fixed.py
```

### Access the Application
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Upload a chest X-ray image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, DCM)
4. View AI analysis results with confidence scores

## üß™ What It Detects

The AI can identify these 14 conditions:
- **Atelectasis** - Lung collapse
- **Cardiomegaly** - Enlarged heart  
- **Effusion** - Fluid accumulation
- **Infiltration** - Inflammatory changes
- **Mass** - Tumor or lesion
- **Nodule** - Small round opacity
- **Pneumonia** - Lung infection
- **Pneumothorax** - Collapsed lung
- **Consolidation** - Lung solidification
- **Edema** - Fluid in lungs
- **Emphysema** - Lung tissue damage
- **Fibrosis** - Lung scarring
- **Pleural Thickening** - Pleural abnormalities
- **Hernia** - Diaphragmatic hernia

## üìã System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **Internet**: Required for initial setup only

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use

1. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop or click to select a chest X-ray
2. **Wait for Analysis**: AI processes the image (takes 5-15 seconds)
3. **View Results**: See detection confidence for each condition
4. **Interactive Charts**: Hover over results for detailed information

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If installation fails with "metadata-generation-failed" or compiler errors:

### If installation fails with "metadata-generation-failed" or compiler errors:

**For Python 3.13+ users:**
```bash
# Install PyTorch first (it handles dependencies better)
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# Then install other requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Alternative - force pre-compiled packages only:**
```bash
# Upgrade pip and install pre-compiled packages
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --only-binary=all -r requirements.txt
```

### If installation fails:
```bash
# Upgrade pip first
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Try installing again
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Common issues:
- **Port 5000 in use**: The app will suggest alternative ports
- **CUDA errors**: The app will automatically fall back to CPU mode
- **Permission errors**: Try running with administrator/sudo privileges
- **pytorch-grad-cam not found**: This is optional for heatmaps, app works without it

**Optional: Install heatmap visualization (may not work with Python 3.13+):**
```bash
pip install pytorch-grad-cam
```

**App won't start?**
- Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Try: `pip install --upgrade pip`

**Upload not working?**
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, DCM
- Maximum file size: 16MB
- Try a different browser

**Slow analysis?**
- First analysis takes longer (model loading)
- Subsequent analyses are faster
- Close other applications to free up RAM
